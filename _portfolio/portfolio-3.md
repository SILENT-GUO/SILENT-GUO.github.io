Thanks to the work done by TA Zhiyang Dou.

Tested Platform: Mac M1 silicon.

Source Code: [code](https://github.com/SILENT-GUO/Ray-Tracing)

## How to run:
After cmake, MODIFY the first two lines of main function in main.cpp.
Modify absolute directory and scenes (in the scene folder) and run main.cpp.
The output result is in outputs folder.

## Future Work:
Implement BST to sort the objects to reduce the cost of intersection test.
