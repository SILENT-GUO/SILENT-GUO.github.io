I am a fourth year underguaduate student from [Department of Computer Science](https://www.cs.hku.hk/) in [Faculty of Engineering](https://engg.hku.hk/) of [HKU](https://www.hku.hk/). My research interest includes character animation, computer graphics, physical simulation and machine learning.

I am very fortunate to have the final-year project titled "physical-based character animation in fluids" advised by Prof. Taku Komura from Department of Computer Science](https://www.cs.hku.hk/).
